In this directory, you can add your model files by creating a pull request. Your model file should be well documented & the name of the file should be `<first_name>_<last_name>.hb`. 

## How to include the model files? 

1. Fork this repository 
2. Clone to your local machine 
3. Create & checkout to new branch. The branch name should be in the manner `<first_name>_<last_name>`. Checkout with the following command: 

	```
	$ git checkout -b meet_soni
	```

	A new branch will be created. Note I've used the name of the branch here for example purpose only.  
4. Include you model file within this branch, for instance  `meet_soni.hb`.
5. Create a PR for your branch.
